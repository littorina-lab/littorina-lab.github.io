It is based on species-specific molecular interactions that prevent heterospecific fertilization. Although gametic incompatibility may occur in any sexually reproducing organism, it has been studied only in a few model species.

The proof of this phenomenon raises an even more important question about the possibility of a parallel, independent formation of similar groups of species rank, repeated at different parts of the species range. This model of speciation is an alternative to the model, which recognizes unique, single and highly stochastic speciation followed by dispersal (young species range formation) and the formation of zones of secondary contact with the populations of the ancestral species.\nIn the framework of the formulated fundamental problem, we offer, on the one hand, to demonstrate the repetitive acts of differentiation of populations of species in ecological gradients at the level of the phenotype and genotype in different geographical regions, and on the other hand, to verify the possibility of independent divergence of the young cryptic species in the same geographic locations on basis of the same genetic data.\nThe selected model system - two groups of cryptic species of the genus Littorina subgenus Neritrema (Mollusca: Caenogastropoda: Littorinidae) - \u0026ldquo;saxatilis\u0026rdquo; (L.arcana, L.compressa, L.saxatilis) and \u0026ldquo;obtusata\u0026rdquo; (L.fabalis, L.obtusata), which form sympatric populations, and whose environmental preferences overlap to varying degree.\nThe project's objective is to carry out comprehensive comparisons within the two categories of objects: (1) intraspecific ecological groups within each of the three species from \u0026ldquo;saxatilis\u0026rdquo; group (a natural model of the situation \u0026ldquo;before the speciation\u0026rdquo;); (2) young species (respectively, interspecies analysis of all five of these species, the natural model of the situation \u0026ldquo;after the speciation\u0026rdquo;).\nWe plan to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of eight populations of each species from 4 geographically distant regions (2 populations from each region - the British Isles, the Atlantic Coast (1); Breton peninsula, the Channel (2); The northern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Norwegian Sea (3); Kola peninsula, the Barents sea (4)). For each of the analyzed categories we will obtain a complex description phenotype of individuals at the morphological (morphometric analysis of shell) and molecular levels (profiles of proteins expressed and metabolites produced), description of environmental preferences (distribution in the intertidal zone, the food spectrum), and genotyping based on restriction-site associated DNA markers (RADseq-tags).\nIn total, such a multilevel analysis will show the formation of parallel rows of variability in different populations of different species at the level of phenotype; genetic analysis will reveal adaptively significant loci and assess whether their composition is similar across species. In addition, it will provide an opportunity to understand how likely is the independent divergence of young species within the cryptic groups at each location.\nThe project will be carried out using the equipment of the St. Petersburg State University resource centers \u0026ldquo;Centre for Molecular and Cell Technologies\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Environmental Safety Observatory\u0026rdquo;.

This project is devoted to analysis of how organisms living in heterogenic environment make their adaption to biotopes occupied.

The effect of trematode parasites on host adaptability and physiology will also be estimated.

Using differential-interference contrast (DIC) for observations of fresh tissue we show that the mature testis consists of numerous ovoid lobules forming larger lobes. The lobules of intact mature testes of _L. saxatilis_ are filled with randomly arranged multicellular cysts containing gametes at different stages of maturation. Gametes within a cyst are highly synchronized in respect of the differentiation degree. At the same time, no spatial gradient in the arrangement of cysts according to the maturation degree of gametes in them was observed in any of the studied lobules. The male gonads contain cysts with early spermatids, mid, late spermatids, and spermatozoa. Using silver-staining, DAPI, and chromomycin A3 (CMA3) staining, we identify 20 main types of nucleus organization in differentiating sperm. Premature and mature male gonads contain cysts with a mosaic arrangement as well as rare solitary cyst cells, goniablast cysts, or separate spermatogonia in between them. Our data indicate that the testis structure in _L. saxatilis_ cannot be attributed to the tubular type, as previously thought. It corresponds to the lobular cyst type but individual lobules contain cysts with gametes at the same stage of development. It is similar to the testis structure of several fishes, amphibians, and _Drosophila melanogaster_. This type of the gonad organization has never been described in gastropods before.","tags":[],"title":"Spermatogenesis and lobular cyst type of testes organization in marine gastropod Littorina saxatilis (Olivi 1792)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546290000,"objectID":"9061b176d61fd8326057b41e0069f8f6","permalink":"/en/expeditions/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/expeditions/","section":"","summary":"Places where we do the field work","tags":null,"title":"Expeditions","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546290000,"objectID":"9645a5b7879eb8537a2401e8d01687bc","permalink":"/en/lab/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/lab/","section":"","summary":"Lab methods we use","tags":null,"title":"Lab","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546290000,"objectID":"68e8a87abd70cee816ffea435e324fa5","permalink":"/en/about-us/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/about-us/","section":"","summary":"People in our lab and our collaborators","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Andrei Granovitch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530230400,"objectID":"21515cba223a1d956daba0d4fd5ac891","permalink":"/en/publication/2018-is-natural-selection-still-a-foundation-stone-of-evolution/","publishdate":"2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2018-is-natural-selection-still-a-foundation-stone-of-evolution/","section":"publication","summary":"The consequences of changes in the genotype of an organism are involved into a system of hierarchical multiple compensation, from the molecular to the biocenotic level.

In case of internally fertilized invertebrates, models to study gamete incompatibility and sperm competition mechanisms are restricted to a single taxon: insects. Here, we propose a group of closely related Littorina species as a new model for such studies. Particularly since periwinkles are already thoroughly studied in terms of morphology, physiology, ecology, phylogeny, and ecological speciation. Earlier, we have identified the first species‐specific Littorina sperm protein (LOSP) with no known conservative domains or homologies. LOSP is relatively abundant component of sperm extracts and might be involved in gamete incompatibility. Here, we characterize its definitive localization and mRNA expression pattern in the male reproductive system by immunocytochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization. We demonstrate that LOSP distribution is limited to the parasperm cells. Losp gene expression occurs only at the early stages of parasperm development. The protein is stored within granules of mature parasperm and, most likely, is released after ejaculation inside female reproductive system. Thus, LOSP is the only described molluscan paraspermal protein to date, and there is a possibility for LOSP to be involved in gamete incompatibility since heterospermy is a common phenomenon among Littorina.","tags":[],"title":"LOSP: A putative marker of parasperm lineage in male reproductive system of the prosobranch mollusk Littorina obtusata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Environmental monitoring of Arctic coastal ecosystems: Sensitivity to petroleum pollution (Arctic EcoSens) RFBR #18-54-20001\nThe state of Arctic biocenoses reflects global dynamic processes associated with climate change and, at the same time, reflects local anthropogenic impact. In the Arctic, the rapid expansion of human economic activity such as oil and gas production is one of significant factors, which impact on natural communities requires a thorough assessment. In addition to practical significance, this situation also provides an opportunity to model biota dynamics in changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the main fundamental component of the project is the assessment of the degree of stability of Arctic biocenoses, the analysis of the mechanisms that ensure it in the gradient of environmental conditions, and development of new approaches for monitoring of Arctic biocenoses.\n   To fullfill the project's goals, it is important that the structure of the complex \u0026ldquo;pollution effect\u0026rdquo; can be quantified as the ratio of the components of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of biogenic, petrogenic and pyrogenic origin (a “fingerprint” passport of PAH pollution at each site studied), and measuring the concentration of heavy metals (working package (WP) 1). This makes it possible to assess the correlation of the “pollution effect” with the structural biocenotic parameters of the model intertidal communities of salt marches and rocky intertidal sites (WP). Moreover, the use of experimental methods such as proteomics and metabolics to assess modell communities allows us to draw conclusions about the effect of factors and the state of biota (WP 3). The main objective of the project is to assess the impact of factors associated with oil and gas production and associated anthropogenic activity in the polar region on model biocenoses using modern geochemical, synecological and autecological approaches, modernization of the methodology for monitoring biocenoses of the Barents Sea at oil production sites, and exchange of experience between Russian and Norwegian research institutes and universities.\nThe project uses the strong side of decades-long scientific cooperation between Russia and Norway, which involves environmental monitoring of the Barents Sea, development of environmental impact standards for both countries.\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"395a0e4b09fb6f1204a4c24cbeae82cb","permalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2018-ecosens/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2018-ecosens/","section":"project","summary":"Environmental monitoring of Arctic coastal ecosystems: Sensitivity to petroleum pollution (Arctic EcoSens)","tags":["Current"],"title":"EcoSens","type":"project"},{"authors":["Olga Muraeva","Arina Maltseva","Marina Varfolomeeva","Natalia Mikhailova","Andrei Granovitch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"b0e0cc3e453f1796e1d830fc5865d2e9","permalink":"/en/publication/2017-mild-osmotic-stress-in-littorina-saxatilis-and-obtusata/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2017-mild-osmotic-stress-in-littorina-saxatilis-and-obtusata/","section":"publication","summary":"Salinity is a crucial abiotic environmental factor for marine animals, affecting their physiology and geographic ranges.

In this study, we compared the reaction to mild water freshening (from 24 to 14 ‰) in two related species of intertidal snails, Littorina saxatilis and L. obtusata, with respect to several aspects: survival, behavior and proteomic changes. Among these species, L. saxatilis is more tolerant to low salinity and survives in estuaries. We found out that the response of these species was much milder (with no mortality or isolation reaction observed) and involved weaker proteomic changes than during acute stress (freshening from 24 to 10 ‰), characterized earlier. The proteomic response of the second species, L. obtusata, was weaker (6 % vs 10 % of regulated proteins) than that of L. saxatilis and engaged a mostly different set of proteins.

Importantly, the set of terms elaborated within the parasitic system concept is applicable not only to parasitology, but also contributes to the general knowledge of life cycles of organisms and differences in the environment. This concept provides an opportunity for comprehensive analysis of systems, based on any type of stable biocoenotic interactions in the community (predation, commensalism, competition, etc.). Trematode-based parasitic systems, involving populations of intertidal mollusks of the genus Littorina, allow demonstrating how the strong “negative” effect of parasites on hosts at the individual level (complete parasitic castration) can be compensated at the population level.
