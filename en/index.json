This project is devoted to analysis of how organisms living in heterogenic environment make their adaption to biotopes occupied. Intertidal snails of the genus Littorina were chosen as a model system. Metabolomics and proteomics as principal approaches will be used for characterizing physiological features of animals collected from wild populations. We will analyze effects of abiotic factors on organisms\u0026rsquo; physiology in dependence on species, intertidal level, trematode infection and gut microsymbionts composition in example of snails; similar analysis of population partitioning will be performed for trematode parasites. So, within one project proteomics, metabolomics, molecular marker analysis, metagenomic analysis of gut microbiome, parasitology and population ecology will be jointed.\nOur goal is to reveal molecular mechanisms of local adaptations on the basis of metabolomic and proteomic profiles analysis in the context of population ecology (intraspecies level) and evolution (interspecies level in the group of closely related species). The effect of trematode parasites on host adaptability and physiology will also be estimated. The relevance of the projects proposed is determined by contribution of expected results to several fundamental biological problems, such as, molecular mechanisms of adaptation; intraspecies plasticity of these mechanisms and its reasons; speciation mechanisms; host-parasite interactions. Such a multifaceted approach puts the proposed project onto current edge of ecological and evolutionary biology and makes the expected results of high demand.\n","date":1546290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546290000,"objectID":"6867fd51917ab7d0fb8ee4b0b25c282f","permalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2019-local-adaptations/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2019-local-adaptations/","section":"project","summary":"Local evolutionary adaptations and host-parasite interactions: multilevel analysis of closely related gastropod species","tags":["Current"],"title":"Local adaptations","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546290000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546290000,"objectID":"68e8a87abd70cee816ffea435e324fa5","permalink":"/en/about-us/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/about-us/","section":"","summary":"People in our lab and our collaborators","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Environmental monitoring of Arctic coastal ecosystems: Sensitivity to petroleum pollution (Arctic EcoSens) RFBR #18-54-20001\n","date":1514754000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514754000,"objectID":"395a0e4b09fb6f1204a4c24cbeae82cb","permalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2018-ecosens/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/rfbr-2018-ecosens/","section":"project","summary":"Environmental monitoring of Arctic coastal ecosystems: Sensitivity to petroleum pollution (Arctic EcoSens)","tags":["Current"],"title":"EcoSens","type":"project"},{"authors":["Olga Muraeva","Arina Maltseva","Natalia Mikhailova","Andrei Granovitch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462924800,"objectID":"67a6f4aa537f5a9ab574a516b37ac45d","permalink":"/en/publication/2016-mechanisms-of-adaption-to-salinity-stress-in-marine-gastropods/","publishdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2016-mechanisms-of-adaption-to-salinity-stress-in-marine-gastropods/","section":"publication","summary":"Salinity is one of the most important abiotic environmental factors for marine animals.
