  abstract = {North Atlantic Littorina species (periwinkles) of the subgenus Neritrema are represented by two groups of morphologically and phylogenetically closely related species—two sister species of the ‘obtusata’ group: Littorina obtusata (Linnaeus, 1758) and L. fabalis (W. Turton, 1825) and three sister species of the ‘saxatilis’ group: L. saxatilis (Olivi, 1792), L. arcana Hannaford Ellis, 1978 and L. compressa Jeffreys, 1865 (Reid, 1996; Reid, Dyal & Williams, 2012). Populations of these species sympatrically inhabit the intertidal zone of the northeastern Atlantic. Evidence of interspecific hybridization has been found between L. saxatilis and L. arcana (Mikhailova et al., 2009; Granovitch et al., 2013), so it is important to study the mechanisms of reproductive isolation that restrict gene flow between Neritrema species. One of the key mechanisms of prezygotic isolation is gamete incompatibility, which is based on the fast evolution of reproductive proteins (Swanson & Vacquier, 2002). To date, reproductive proteins have not been characterized in Neritrema species. Here we report data on a completely new protein from L. obtusata sperm, which has no homologue in databases, but may play an important role in reproductive isolation between Neritrema species.},
